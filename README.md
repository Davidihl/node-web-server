# Node Web Server (https)

## Step 1

Start the Webserver

```bash
node index.js
```

Following filetypes are supported:
.html
.htm
.jpg

If you enter just a directory, the server tries to redirect you to index.html and if it is not found, index.htm
Only files within the `public` directory considered.
